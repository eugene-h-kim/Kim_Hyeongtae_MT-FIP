## Introduction - Lysol Beer Brand

While looking for new eco-friendly ingredients by Lysol, which makes disinfecting cleaner products, it succeeded in extracting new ingredients that have not been known so far from hop, a raw material for beer. This ingredient, named Lysol Hop, can dramatically kill bacteria and viruses up to 99.9%, but is completely harmless to the human body, further increasing the taste of beer through a series of processes. Lysol and Budweiser have found the possibility of Lysol Hop and launched a new beer brand Lysol Beer based on it.

## Features

Since Lysol Beer is a joint brand between Lysol and Budweiser, overall brand visual identity was applied to the Lysol Brand based on Budweiser's Brand Color, Typography, and Tone & Manner. It is designed to remind consumers of Budweiser beers and to feel familiar with the new Lysol Beer brand.

I Designed it for a Mid-Term of the Final Integrated Project of this Winter semester 2022 of Interactive Media Design at Fanshawe College.
